# Personal IMDB App

## About App
This app was made for users who love watching movies and doing reviews. I thought it would be easier if people took take a photo after watching the movie so they could save their reaction. I got this idea from rollercoasters, where they take picture of you during the ride

## Allows users to
- Create Videos
- Upload videos
- Choose their own top 100 movie  
- Give their own reaction to movies via photo

---

## Research
 - Using IMBD to get the top 100 movies, _Movie ID is actually related to movie links_
 - [Used github to learn how to use the camera function for xamarin forms](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/MediaPlugin "Media Plugin")
 - Most of async and data storage was from labs
